# Scratch Paper; single page notes.
A hyper-minimal 'single-page' notes app, for scratch notes and reminders.

The successor to the now deprecated [Jot](https://github.com/Gamemackerel/Jot.), but multi-platform and built with react native.

This is an expo app, start a development server with `npx expo start`

Update dependencies by following these [instructions](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/upgrading-expo-sdk-walkthrough/).

## TODO

* Build new text editor using react-native-keyboard-controller or scratch keyboard controller. (KeyboardAwareScrollView is less than perfect)
* Fix android notification icon (it's mysteriously blank)
* Retain notification ordering

### Future work
* Add two finger tap to begin dictation
* Swipe left to preview an AI "autocomplete" suggestion, swipe right to confirm suggestion
